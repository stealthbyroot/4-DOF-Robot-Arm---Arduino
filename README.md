# 4-DOF-Robot-Arm---Arduino Project

<<< How to control 4 DFO Robot Arm with Arduino using joystick shield >>>

Material needed:
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x Arduino joystick shield
- 4x SG-90 servo motors 180 degrees
- 1x Robot arm assembly - usually sourced from Ali Express
- 1x External power supply 5V/5A (or more amps)
- 1x power supply 5V/1A for Arduino Uno
- Wires, connectors, etc.

Please don't ask me how to do it, you are on your own. I spent so much time making this thing work, and it should have been done in a few hours. 

Few tips:
- pay attention to the motor position before you install it
- an external PSU is a must for servo motors, roughly for each servo motor you need 1A
- test each servo motor before installation
- all joints need to be adjusted, not too tight not too loose, if needed lubricate
- arm assembly instructions you can find anywhere on the internet

pin = A0  - base
pin = A1 - right servo
pin = A2 - left servo
pin = A3 - claw

The schematic and video will be published soon.
