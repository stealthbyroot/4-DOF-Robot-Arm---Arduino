# 4-DOF-Robot-Arm---Arduino Project

<<< How to control 4 DFO Robot Arm with Arduino using joystick shield >>>

Material needed:
1x Arduino Uno
1x Arduino joystick shield
4x SG-90 servo motors 180 degrees
1x Robot arm assembly - usually sourced from Ali Express
1x External power supply 5V/5A (or more amps)
1x power supply for Arduino Uno
Wires, connectors, etc.

Please don't ask me how to do it, you are on your own. I spent so much time making this thing work, and it should have been done in a few hours. 
Few tips:

- pay attention to the motor position before you install it
- an external PSU is a must, roughly for each servo motor you need 1A
